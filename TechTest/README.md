APP TESTED ON Pixel XL API 27

This is a technical app for a job application to be a summer intern at SalonEverywhere.
ToDo:
1) Create an app that can log in and sign up users using amplify **DONE**
	App also makes you confrim using a verfication code sent to email, it also has the ability to resend the code.
2) Create support for profile pictures that can be uploaded and changed and still be there after logging in 
		The app currently allows you to upload a profile picture and set it. It lets you update it, take pictures from gallery or camera. Unfournatly, i could not
		figure out how to retrieve the picture properly using S3 so i was unable to have the profile picture save after signing out.
3) Create a webview of SalonEverywhere profiles**DONE** 
4) App does not posses any broken links,pages,etc...looks clean and intuative**DONE**
